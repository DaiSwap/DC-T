Python script designed to control drone using the DroneKit library while simultaneously utilizing the YOLO model for real-time object detection.

1. **Library Imports:**
    - `cv2` (OpenCV): Used for capturing video from the camera and displaying it.
    - `numpy`: Image processing tasks.
    - `pydarknet`: A Python wrapper for the Darknet YOLO implementation, used for object detection.
    - `dronekit`: A library that allows communication and control of drones using the MAVLink protocol.

2. **Drone Connection:**
    - The drone is connected via a serial connection (usually over USB) using `dronekit.connect`.

3. **YOLO Model Loading:**
    - The YOLO model is loaded using the `Detector` class from `pydarknet`. Configuration files and weights are specified for the model.

4. **Camera Initialization:**
    - OpenCV is used to capture video from the default camera (`cv2.VideoCapture(0)`).

5. **Main Loop:**
    - The script enters a loop where it continuously captures frames from the camera.
    - Each frame is passed through the YOLO object detector to identify objects within the frame.

6. **Object Detection and Decision Making:**
    - For each detected object, if the object is classified as a "person," the script calculates the error in the x and y positions between the detected person’s center and the center of the frame.
    - A simple proportional controller calculates the forward and right movements needed to center the detected person in the frame.
    - These movements are then translated into control commands which are sent to the drone using `vehicle.channels.overrides`.

7. **Display and Cleanup:**
    - The frame with detections is displayed using OpenCV.
    - The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed.
    - Finally, the script releases the camera, closes all OpenCV windows, and closes the connection to the drone.

## Purpose

The script aims to demonstrate a basic example of autonomous drone control based on real-time visual input. Specifically, it uses computer vision to detect a hotspot and adjusts the drone’s position to keep the hotspot centered in the camera's field of view.
